I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [School of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences of the University of Galway](https://www.universityofgalway.ie/science/school-of-maths/).

My research is in the field of Algebra, more specifically, Group Theory. That includes questions about finite groups, their representations and related combinatorial stractures. 

This page is under development, so there is not much to see yet. But you can chack out my [CV](antonCV.pdf)!
