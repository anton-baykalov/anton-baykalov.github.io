I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [School of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences](https://www.universityofgalway.ie/science/school-of-maths/) at the [University of Galway](https://www.universityofgalway.ie/). Here I work with [Angela Carnevale](https://angelacarnevale.github.io/) and [Tobias Rossmann](https://torossmann.github.io/)  on a project related to explicit computations of subobject zeta functions of groups, algebras and other algebraic structures. 

In general, my research is in the field of Algebra, more specifically, Group Theory. That includes questions about finite groups, their representations and related combinatorial stractures. I obtained my PhD in the end of 2021 at the University of Auckland and I worked there as a research assistant and a lecturer until June 2023. I was a postdoc at the University of Western Australia from June 2023 to December 2024. 

This page is under development, so there is not much to see yet. But you can chack out my [CV](antonCV.pdf)!
