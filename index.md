I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [School of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences](https://www.universityofgalway.ie/science/school-of-maths/) at the [University of Galway](https://www.universityofgalway.ie/). Here I work with [Angela Carnevale](https://angelacarnevale.github.io/) and [Tobias Rossmann](https://torossmann.github.io/)  on a project involving explicit computations of zeta functions of groups, algebras and other algebraic structures. In particular, I am interested in using machine learning to assist with these computations.

In general, my research is in the field of Algebra, more specifically Group Theory. This includes questions about groups, their representations and related combinatorial stractures. I obtained my PhD in the end of 2021 at the [University of Auckland](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en.html) and I worked there as a research assistant and a lecturer until June 2023. I was a postdoc at the [University of Western Australia](https://www.uwa.edu.au/) from June 2023 to December 2024.
